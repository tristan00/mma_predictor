RF using fighter age, time since last fight, and fight history to predict matchups

to look into:

-recent elo changes .

-trends in fight metrics, ie used to finish in first round now usually takes 2-3.

-fight metrics as a function of opponent skill, ei finishe rate as a function of oponent elo. will look into autoencoder for this.
